# Samsung Innovation Campus AI Certificate 2025

Welcome to my **Samsung Innovation Campus AI Certificate (2025)** repository. This repo contains all coursework, projects, assignments, notes, and experiments completed during the AI certification program.

## 📜 Overview

The Samsung Innovation Campus AI Certificate is a structured program focused on building strong foundations in Artificial Intelligence, including:

- Python for AI  
- Machine Learning fundamentals  
- Deep Learning concepts  
- Computer Vision and NLP basics  
- Model deployment practices  
- Hands-on algorithms implementation (e.g., Naïve Bayes, KNN, SVM)  
- Practical integration with real-world projects like WebPOSAI
